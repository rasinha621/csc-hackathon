# SQL Practice

Your organization is planning on doing c3 outreach to get people for GOTV but disaster, the SQL isn't working! Help fix this by finding all the errors and getting us a working list of contacts to canvass. 

# Instructions
Make a fork of this repo then go wild! Feel free to use whatever tools you think might help you and then try running it in BigQuery. Feel free to flag down any TMC folks for help!
